        <p>The intention of this guide is to aid both the student and instructors while conducting training in the R44. 
            It should be understood that because of the many variables in geographic location, altitudes, loading and individual 
            instructor techniques, minor modifications to certain maneuvers might be necessary. For the purposes of training, the 
            following parameters should be adhered to:</p>

            <article>
                <p>Attitude or pitch control with the cyclic is the most important aspect of straight and level flight. 
                    A level flight attitude is best determined by referencing the horizon with a fixed point in the cockpit, 
                    such as the magnetic compass or the tip path plane. The pilot will be able to detect changes in attitude 
                    by noting changes between the fixed point and the horizon. Airspeed is determined by attitude and controlled 
                    by the cyclic. As in all helicopters, the R44 cyclic control is very sensitive and requires very slight pressure to
                    effect a change. Normal cruise airspeed for training is 90 KTS.
                    Altitude is controlled primarily by the collective. Each collective movement will require a corresponding pedal adjustment 
                    to maintain the aircraft in trim. An increase of collective will require left pedal. A collective decrease will require right pedal. 
                    Additionally, when the collective is increased, the nose will tend to rise, requiring slight forward cyclic to maintain a level or cruise 
                    flight attitude. The opposite is true with a decrease in collective—the nose will move down, requiring a slight aft cyclic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The governor will control RPM. However, should the governor fail, the RPM is correlated and few throttle adjustments will be required. 
                    High manifold pressure settings or high- density altitude conditions will require the pilot to maintain RPM with throttle, in the event 
                    of a governor failure. An increase in collective will require an increase in throttle to prevent low RPM. A decrease in collective will 
                    require a decrease in throttle to prevent high RPM.

           <h1>Climbs</h1>
           <p>For training purposes, climb airspeed is 60 KTS at 500 feet per minute rate of climb. From straight and level flight at 90 KTS, clear above the aircraft. 
               Initiate the climb by increasing collective to climb power (manifold pressure setting which will provide a 500 ft/min climb at 60 KTS). The governor will 
               maintain the RPM. Maintain aircraft trim with a slight amount of left pedal and apply aft cyclic to adjust the attitude to a "60 KT climb attitude". 50 feet 
               prior to reaching the level-off altitude, begin the level off by lowering the nose to a 90 KT attitude with forward cyclic, decreasing the collective slowly 
               to cruise power (manifold pressure setting for level flight at 90 KTS). Maintain aircraft trim with right pedal. Throughout the climb and level-off, continually 
               crosscheck outside references—(attitude and heading) with inside references—(flight instruments).
            </p>
            <h1>Descents</h1>
            <p>For training purposes, descent airspeed is 60 KTS at 500 feet per minute rate of descent. From straight and level flight at 90 KTS, clear below the aircraft. 
                Initiate the descent by decreasing collective to a manifold pressure setting that will provide a 500 feet per minute descent at 60 KTS. Maintain aircraft trim 
                with a slight amount of right pedal, the governor will maintain the RPM. Apply aft cyclic to adjust the attitude to a "60 KT attitude". 50 feet prior to reaching 
                the level-off altitude, begin the level off by increasing the collective slowly to cruise power. Maintain aircraft trim with left pedal. Apply forward cyclic to 
                adjust the attitude to a level flight attitude. Throughout the descent and level-off, continually crosscheck outside references—(attitude and heading) with inside 
                references—(flight instruments).

   <section class="main-section" id="turns">
       <header>Turns</header>
       <article>
           <p>From straight and level flight at 90 KTS, clear the aircraft in the direction of turn. Smoothly apply cyclic towards the direction of turn until the desired angle of 
               bank is reached. Unlike an airplane, the pedals should not be used to assist the turn. Use the horizon as a reference to maintain a "90 KT attitude" and desired angle 
               of bank with cyclic. As the angle of bank increases, additional collective may be required to maintain altitude. Keep the aircraft in trim with the pedals. Begin the 
               recovery from the turn just prior to reaching the desired rollout heading. Apply cyclic opposite the direction of turn, and if any collective has been added during the 
               turn, reduce it back to cruise power, while maintaining aircraft trim.

   <section class="main-section" id="acceleration">
       <header>Acceleration / Deceleration</header>
       <article>
           <p>From straight and level flight at 90 KTS, slowly increase the collective approximately 2” above cruise power, adding left pedal and forward cyclic. As the aircraft begins to 
              accelerate, adjust cyclic, collective and pedals, (the governor will control the RPM) as necessary to stabilize at 110 KTS and level flight. Begin the deceleration by slowly 
              reducing the collective co-coordinated with right pedal and aft cyclic. Again, use all controls slowly and smoothly as necessary to decelerate to 60 KTS and level flight. Accelerate 
              back to 90 KTS by increasing collective to cruise power, left pedal and forward cyclic to attain level flight at 90 KTS.
              Throughout the maneuver, a constant crosscheck of airspeed, altitude, attitude, RPM and trim must be maintained.

   <section class="main-section" id="takeoff_hover">
       <header>Takeoff to a Hover</header>
       <article>
           <p>After completing a pre-takeoff check, clear the helicopter left and right. With the collective full down and the cyclic and pedals neutralized, slowly increase the throttle. As the 
               RPM passes 80%, the governor will activate and increase the RPM to 102%. Increase the collective and a small amount of left pedal will be required to compensate for the increased 
               torque. As the helicopter becomes light on the skids, select a reference point 50 to 75 feet in front of the helicopter and neutralize all aircraft movement with the cyclic and pedals. 
               Continue to increase the collective smoothly and slowly, maintaining heading with slight pedal corrections. Since the R44 normally hovers in a nose high attitude with two occupants, the 
               toes of the skids will break ground first. Compensate with forward cyclic. As the helicopter becomes light on the skids, extreme caution must be used to avoid any rearward or lateral movement 
               since this can cause an immediate rollover. Should any lateral or rearward movement occur, immediately lower the collective and begin again. The helicopter should rise vertically, maintaining 
               heading with pedals, position over the ground with cyclic, and altitude with the collective. After attaining a stabilized 5-foot hover, perform hover check:

        <header>Landing From a Hover</header>
        <article>
            <p>From a stabilized 5-foot hover, headed into the wind, slightly lower the collective to establish a slow rate of sink. A small amount of right pedal will be needed to maintain heading. 
                The cyclic will be used to maintain position over the ground. Vision should be directed 50–75 feet in front of the helicopter. Do not look immediately in front of the helicopter, as this will 
                lead to over controlling.
            </p>
            <p>As the helicopter descends to about 6 inches, additional downward pressure on the collective may be necessary to overcome the increase in ground effect. As the skids make ground contact, neutralize 
                all aircraft movement with cyclic and pedals, continuing to smoothly lower the collective until it is full down. Due to the nose high attitude of the R44 with two people aboard, the heels of the skids 
                will normally touch first on level terrain. A slight amount of aft cyclic will be necessary as ground contact is made.
